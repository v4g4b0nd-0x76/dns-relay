# dns-relay

A small DNS server, written in Rust, that lets you control how specific domains resolve. It's built for personal use — mainly redirecting or dropping domains, and resolving everything else through resolvers you trust — and is intentionally simple rather than a full-featured recursive resolver.

This component is the **main resolver**: the thing you (or the `resolver_proxy` component, or your OS/router) send DNS queries to. See [`../resolver_proxy/README.md`](../resolver_proxy/README.md) for the companion component that gets queries to this resolver without them being visible as plaintext DNS on a censored network path.

## What it does

It binds to UDP port 53 and, for each incoming query:

1. Checks a **drop list** — if the domain matches, it replies with NXDOMAIN instead of resolving anything.
2. Checks a **redirect list** — if the domain matches a pattern, it replies with a chosen IP address directly, skipping real resolution entirely.
3. Checks an in-memory **LRU cache** — if a recent answer for this exact query is cached, it's served immediately (with the transaction ID rewritten to match the new request), avoiding a repeat lookup.
4. Otherwise, it resolves the domain through a normal upstream resolver (DoH endpoint, plain UDP resolver, or DoQ), or, if configured, through a **relay** — an encrypted tunnel that performs the DNS-over-HTTPS lookup on your behalf (see [Relay config](#relay-config)).

If it's receiving queries from the `resolver_proxy` component, it decodes the obfuscated/TLS-wrapped packet back into a normal DNS query, runs it through the same pipeline above, then re-encodes the answer the same way before sending it back — the proxy and the resolver are designed to be run as a pair across a censored network boundary.

**Note:** DoQ support exists and is gated behind `init_tls = true`. In testing against free public DoQ resolvers this didn't reliably work, so you may want to leave it disabled and stick to DoH/plain UDP resolvers.

## Build

```bash
./scripts/build.sh          # native (GNU Linux or macOS M4)
./scripts/build.sh musl     # static Linux musl
./scripts/build.sh gnu      # Linux GNU
./scripts/build.sh mac      # aarch64-apple-darwin (M4)
make test
```

## Use as a Rust library

Adding the crate uses only its resolver API; it does not start the DNS server,
bind port 53, or change system DNS.

```toml
[dependencies]
dns_relay = "1"
```

```rust
use dns_relay::{DnsResolver, ResolverConfig};

let resolver = DnsResolver::new(ResolverConfig {
    resolvers: vec![
        "https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query".into(),
        "1.1.1.1:53".into(),
    ],
    relay: None,
})
.await?;

let addresses = resolver.resolve_ipv4("example.com").await?;
```

Keep one `DnsResolver` for the lifetime of the application so its connections,
health state, DNS cache, and concurrent lookup sharing are reused. Set `relay`
to an existing `RelayConf` when DNS queries should use the encrypted Cloudflare
Worker or Google Apps Script path.

Since it needs to bind to port 53, it needs elevated privileges. Either run it with `sudo`, or grant the capability directly so it doesn't need to run as root:

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep PATH_TO_BINARY
```

## Running in the background

No systemd or launchd service is required. The binary can detach itself and
keep its PID and log in a private per-user state directory:

```bash
dns_relay --conf /absolute/path/conf.toml run --background
dns_relay logs --follow
dns_relay stop
```

On Linux the state directory is `$XDG_STATE_HOME/dns_relay` (or
`~/.local/state/dns_relay`); on macOS it is
`~/Library/Application Support/dns_relay`. The process is detached from the
terminal, so it stays running after the terminal closes. It still needs the
privileges required by its configuration: binding port 53 requires `sudo` or
the Linux `cap_net_bind_service` capability.

## Config format

The base config controls the drop list, redirect list, and which upstream resolvers to use:

```toml
record_history = true
# if true, resolved records for each domain are appended to history.txt.
# useful if your ISP silently strips/alters A records and you want a record of it.

# Reject unauthenticated UDP upstreams. At least one DoH, DoQ, or HTTPS relay is required.
secure_only = false

# Optional IPv4 /24 override; omit to discover through a direct relay Worker.
# client_subnet = "8.8.8.0/24"

# domains you want blocked (resolve to nothing / NXDOMAIN)
drop_list = [
    "google.com",
    "*.example.com",
]

# domains you want resolved to a specific IP instead of their real answer
redirect_list = [
    "*.test.com:192.168.1.1",
]

# public resolvers to use for everything else
resolvers = [
    "https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query",
    "8.8.8.8:53",
    "1.1.1.1:53",
]
```

Both `drop_list` and `redirect_list` support wildcard patterns (`*.example.com` matches both `example.com` and any subdomain). `resolvers` can mix DoH URLs and plain `ip:port` UDP resolvers; the healthiest/fastest ones are preferred automatically (see [Resolver searching](#resolver-searching)).

With `secure_only = true`, plain UDP resolvers are excluded and zero-only A/AAAA sinkhole responses are rejected before caching. Startup fails unless at least one authenticated DoH, DoQ, or HTTPS relay path is configured.

There's a built-in LRU cache — once a name has been resolved, repeat queries are served from memory instead of re-querying a resolver each time.

### Resolver searching

To fetch resolvers from open-source lists and health-check them concurrently:

```toml
[resolver_searching]
enable = false
resolver_source = [
 "https://public-dns.info/nameservers-all.txt",
 "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickest/resolvers/main/resolvers.txt"
]
refresh_interval = 30
ipv4 = true
doh = true
```

Discovered resolvers are latency-tested and merged into the healthy pool; resolvers that fail a health check are remembered for an hour so they aren't retried every cycle.

## Relay config

If you want DNS queries to go through an encrypted relay instead of querying resolvers directly — useful when something on the network path is tampering with or blocking plain DNS — there's a `relay_conf` section. Each relay instance is AES-256-GCM encrypted end-to-end between the Rust client and the final resolver, so on the wire it looks like an ordinary HTTPS POST, not DNS traffic. There are two supported ways to reach a relay instance: **direct** (straight to a Cloudflare Worker) and **google_chained** (routed through a Google Apps Script hop first, in front of the same kind of Worker).

```toml
[relay_conf]
enable = true

[[relay_conf.relay_instances]]
relay_key = "<base64 AES-256-GCM key>"
relay_url = "https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/"
transport = "direct"

[[relay_conf.relay_instances]]
relay_key = "<base64 AES-256-GCM key>"
relay_url = "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/exec"
transport = "google_chained"
```

`[[relay_conf.relay_instances]]` can be repeated as many times as you like, mixing transports freely; the tool round-robins across all configured instances. `transport` defaults to `"direct"` if omitted, so existing single-Worker configs don't need to change.

In secure mode, a direct Worker relay discovers the caller's public IPv4 `/24` and sends it as ECS so CDN answers retain the client's geography. Discovery failure does not weaken transport security: DNS continues without ECS and retries later. Google-chained-only setups cannot discover the original address through Apps Script, so set `client_subnet` when exact geography is required.

### Why two transports

A direct Cloudflare Worker relay is simple and fast, but on some networks (this was built with Iranian ISP-level filtering in mind) Cloudflare's own IP ranges get blocked outright while Google's generally don't. The `google_chained` transport exists for that case: the same encrypted DNS packet gets wrapped in one more hop — a small Google Apps Script web app — before reaching the Cloudflare Worker. Apps Script runs on Google's own infrastructure, so if Google is reachable but Cloudflare isn't, this extra hop still gets you there.

Both transports use the _same_ `relay_key` semantics: it's always the AES-256-GCM key shared between the Rust client and the Cloudflare Worker that actually performs the DoH lookup. The Google Apps Script hop, when used, never sees this key and can't decrypt anything — it only handles already-encrypted, base64-wrapped ciphertext, plus an opaque cache tag (an HMAC of the domain, derived from the same key) that lets it cache repeat lookups without ever learning what domain was queried.

### Setting up a Cloudflare Worker (direct transport)

1. Generate a relay key locally (never sent anywhere): the tool's key-generation CLI command prints a base64 AES-256-GCM key.
2. Deploy a Worker that decrypts incoming requests with this key, forwards the decrypted DNS query to a DoH endpoint (e.g. `https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query`), and re-encrypts the reply with the same key before returning it.
3. Store the key as a Worker **secret** (`wrangler secret put RELAY_KEY`), not hardcoded in the Worker's source.
4. Put the same key and the Worker's URL into `conf.toml` as a `relay_instances` entry with `transport = "direct"`.

### Setting up the Google Apps Script hop (google_chained transport)

1. In [script.google.com](https://script.google.com), create a new project with a `doPost` handler that: reads a JSON body containing the base64-encoded encrypted packet and a cache-key tag, checks its own cache for that tag, and if not cached, forwards the decoded bytes to your Cloudflare Worker's URL via `UrlFetchApp`, then caches and returns the Worker's (still-encrypted) response.
2. Store the actual Cloudflare Worker URL in the project's **Script Properties** (`Project Settings → Script Properties`), not hardcoded and not sent by the client — this keeps the deployment from being usable as an open relay to arbitrary destinations.
3. Deploy it as a **Web app** (`Deploy → New deployment → Web app`), with **Execute as: Me** and **Who has access: Anyone** — "Anyone" is required since the Rust client calls it anonymously with no Google login.
4. Copy the resulting `.../exec` URL (this includes the deployment ID — there's no separate place to configure that) into `conf.toml` as `relay_url`, alongside the _same_ `relay_key` used by the underlying Worker, with `transport = "google_chained"`.
5. If you edit the script later, redeploy as a **new version of the existing deployment** (rather than a brand-new deployment) to keep the same `.../exec` URL, so `conf.toml` doesn't need updating each time.

### Metrics

Enable the `[metric_conf]` block to watch resolver behaviour, reporting to the terminal log or an HTTP `/metrics` endpoint:

```toml
[metric_conf]
enable = true
report_type = "log"       # "log" or "http"
report_interval = 30      # seconds between log lines
```

For `report_type = "http"`, health and metrics are available at `http://127.0.0.1:5053/health` and `http://127.0.0.1:5053/metrics`.

**Note:** in console (`log`) mode, a new log line is only emitted when the request count differs from the previous interval, so idle periods don't spam the log.

### VPN resilience

VPN clients with a kill switch (Windscribe, NordVPN, Mullvad, etc.) tend to do two things that fight a local resolver like this one:

1. **Firewall non-tunnel UDP traffic**, including outbound queries this tool sends to plain `ip:port` resolvers on port 53 — even though that traffic is legitimate, it looks identical to a DNS leak.
2. **Overwrite system DNS** with their own resolver the moment they connect, so the OS stops sending queries here at all — bypassing the drop/redirect lists entirely.

Two features address this automatically, no configuration required:

- **DoH-first resolution**: if a VPN interface is detected, the picker prefers any `https://` entry in your `resolvers` list over plain UDP ones, since DoH traffic is ordinary HTTPS and essentially never blocked by a kill switch. Make sure at least one DoH resolver is configured for this to have something to fall back to.
- **DNS reassertion (netguard)**: a background loop detects VPN interfaces (`utun*`, `wg*`, `tun*`, etc.) and continuously re-points system DNS back at this resolver:
  - **macOS**: reasserts DNS on every network service via `networksetup`, _and_ directly overwrites the live `State:/Network/Service/<id>/DNS` entry via `scutil` for whichever service is currently primary — this is the config VPN clients actually hijack, which plain `networksetup` calls alone don't reach.
  - **Linux**: uses `resolvectl` (systemd-resolved) if available, applying both the resolver and a `~.` default-route domain to every link; falls back to rewriting `/etc/resolv.conf` directly if `resolvectl` isn't present.

This runs as a continuous poll (roughly every 1.5s), since VPN clients reassert their own DNS on their own schedule too — expect a brief window on connect/reconnect before this resolver wins the config back.

**Requires root/sudo** (or the `setcap` capability described above, though `networksetup`/`resolvectl` calls specifically may still need elevated privileges depending on your OS's policy).

### Limits worth knowing

Google Apps Script has real quotas (roughly 20,000 outbound fetches/day on a free account, a several-minute execution budget per call, no built-in high-concurrency handling), and adds noticeably more latency per request than a Cloudflare Worker alone. The built-in per-hop caching helps offset this for repeat lookups, but it's a fallback path for when Cloudflare itself is unreachable, not a primary one.

## CLI

Aside from running the server, there are standalone commands for setup and troubleshooting — generating a relay key, and resolving a single domain (optionally through a relay) without running the full server. Exact flag names may vary by version; check `--help` on your build for the authoritative list.

### Notes

- Tested manually on both Linux and macOS; no guarantee everything works identically on every setup.
- Bug reports and feature suggestions are welcome.
